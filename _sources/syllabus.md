## Meetings

### Lecture time sessions

We will discuss topics of interest for the whole class during lecture times (MW 5-6:15 pm PST). Students are expected to attend. 

```{note}
We don't expect to meet every session, and class Google calendar will reflect any cancellations.
```

### Team meetings

Team meetings will be central to your project work. Students will give weekly updates and receive guidance and suggestions based on their findings.

Each project team will collectively decide on a weekly standing meeting time. A team representative will update the class Google calendar with the meeting information including the Zoom link.

```{tip}
Recommended weekly meeting format:

* **First 30 minutes**: high-level weekly updates to sponsor and faculty mentor
* **Second 30 minutes**: low-level discussion of methods and results
```

### Discussion times

These times are held as placeholders for additional common time slots. These time slots can be used for ad-hoc meetings, requesting help from TAs, etc.

```{tip}
TAs will work with you to troubleshoot technology problems
```



## Grading

You are expected to fully engage with your project groups. While you will be assigned a letter grade, the evaluation is based on your participation and group work. The following will be the grading criteria.

* **Participation (individual)**: 40%  
    Attendance in group meetings and lecture time sessions
* **Deliverables (group)**: 30%  
    3 progress updates in this Jupyter book
* **End of Quarter Presentation (group)**: 20%  
    Report and video presentation
* **Sponsor/Mentor Evaluation (individual)**: 10%  
    Based on your engagement and contribution to the project

### Participation

Each team will collectively keep track of attendance in a [shared Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HBH5tDCe9k_Z0TM9R6zQupgnGf2no3KFRCqQBHB5XlA/edit?usp=sharing) (sharing settings not yet configured). 

### Deliverables

Each team will create a progress update document as a section in this Jupyter book (more details will be added). Consider the document as periodic milestones toward your final report and presentation.

Each team will complete three progress updates by these dates:
* End of day on January 31, 2021
* End of day on February 21, 2021
* End of day on March 14, 2021

After initial updates, you can continue to modify and improve your updates.

### End of Quarter Presentations

Final summary report of your project and a video presentation with slides will wrap-up your quarter (more details will be added).
