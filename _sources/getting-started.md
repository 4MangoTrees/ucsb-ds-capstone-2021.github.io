# Project Management

Because you will be collaborating with your team, structuring your communication and workflow will be important for efficiency and organization.

After considering different platforms, we propose that groups use Github and related tools as much as possible.

## Source Code Version Control

* Git for version control  
    Not just for your code, but also for your documents (markdown is recommended)
* Github project board  
    Kanban style project management tool integrated with Github issues
* Github discussion  
    Forum style discussion with thread
