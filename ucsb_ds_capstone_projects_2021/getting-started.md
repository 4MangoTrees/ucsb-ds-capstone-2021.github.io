# Getting Started

We are excited to have you as students in the first capstone project course offering!

This [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org) will be the central place to find all course material for the course as well as host your project progress in the future.

Because you will be collaborating with your team, structuring your communication and workflow will be important for efficiency and organization.

After considering different platforms, we propose that groups use Github and related tools as much as possible.

* Git for version control  
    Not just for your code, but also for your documents (markdown is recommended)
* Github project board  
    Kanban style project management tool integrated with Github issues
* Github discussion  
    Forum style discussion with thread
