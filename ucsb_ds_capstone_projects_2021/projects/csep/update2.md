### Introduction
The CSEP Alumni Tracking Project tracks students graduating from  2000 - 2018 from the University of California, Santa Barbara. The overall goal of tracking students is monitoring opportunites UCSB provides and the impact on student outcomes. 

The data comes from a mix of sources: online - LinkedIn, personal websites, and professional organizations - and UCSB's own information about students. While not all of the data was accessed through an automated system, some of it required some manual revisions to determine if a student's data is updated. So while we collected from some of the sources listed above, there will exist some type of error whether it is a simple mispelling of a word to texts existing in an integer column. 

The organization providing the data does not have an overall goal for the outcome of the data: the CSEP group is free to explore any possible avenue for the data within reason.  

### Accessing the Secure Research Compute Environment (SCRE)
SCRE is a way for the team to access the data without having any breaches in the security of the data itself. Because the data we are using is of actual past UCSB alumni, we don't want to expose any sensitive information of each individual. While on SCRE, we're not only able to access this information, but we're also able to play around with it in python code on our virtual machines! 

More specifically, each capstone member is assigned a specific Virtual Machine (VM) that allows the designated user to access the data through that VM. An important aspect to note is that while UCSB maintains a complete and thorough alumni dataset, not all of it is allocated to our team. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) restricts the alumni and student information that institutions such as UCSB can release. For this reason, our team only works with a portion of the alumni dataset in a secure environment as a means to respect the privacy of UCSB alumni and students.
