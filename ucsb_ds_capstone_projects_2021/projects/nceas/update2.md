## Update 2
Febrauary 28, 2021

### Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Datasets: R package
### Project Sponsor: National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) 
#### Team Members: Sam Guo, Adhitya Logan, Lia Ran, Sophia Sternberg, Karen Zhao


**Progress**
- We began coworking hours on Fridays in addition to our weekly meeting on Mondays for more collaboration and to share ideas/troubleshooting.
- Learned the workflow of creating an R package from scratch (documentation, license, github, function ) through the say_aloha (insert link)
- We each created 3 of our own demo datasets, 2 where the data was provided for us, and 1 where we chose our own dataset from any LTER site. 
- Incorporated what we learned in past weeks (github workflow, tidyverse, metajam) by putting them together.
- Large importance placed on the creation of vignettes and we are really thinking of who they are for in the process of building them out. 
- We started presenting our demo packages and vignettes during our weekly meetings as a form of updates/feedback. 
- Our installable R packages can be found here (insert five Github links)

    - Sophia: [Sophiaâ€™s Package] ()

Examples of Visualizations in our packages (all produced using ggplot from the tidyverse package)

Sophia: The first image shows an initial view of the Bull Shark Count Overtime. This data is from the Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE) LTER Site. I thought this was an interesting plot to include because of the pattern happening YoY. The second image shows the relationship between Temperature and Bull Sharks. I thought this was important to include because it brings up an important point about the nature of collecting data and taking data with a grain of salt. From a first glance, it appears that more Bull Sharks are counted when the Temperature is higher; however researchers are also more likely to survey when the Temperature is warmer/nicer and that may be a bias in the data and affect the number of Bull Sharks counted.

**Future Plans**
- For the remainder of this quarter, we plan to refine our packages and vignettes even more, while adding more in-depth descriptions and other important metadata about our packages. To do this, we will really need to know our datasets inside and out and understand every nuance. 
- We will need to start deciding what datasets we will import to our final product and map out a plan of how to best collaborate on this.
