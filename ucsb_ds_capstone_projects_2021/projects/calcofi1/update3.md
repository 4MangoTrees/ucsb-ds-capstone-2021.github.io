# CALCOLFI Project Update 3

## Overview
CALCOFI is an organization tasked with studying the marine environment of coastal California and investigating the relationships between climate, fish population, and other human activities. Our project primarily focuses on two datasets:
    1. Landing - A dataset comprised of multiple fish species and how many of them were caught and sold for various price over the years.
    2. Larvae - A dataset comprised of multiple fish species and how many of their larvae was seen over the years.
In the beginning, we were using these two datasets, we intend to find any relationships, if there are any, between fish larvae and fish being caught. As time passes, our workflow and goal has changed to become more developed, and we have introduced new datasets into our project including:
    3/4. Bottle & Cast - 2 datasets that work hand in hand with one another where it contain records  of the environmental conditions where the fish and larvae occupy. Cast contains information about the cruise being sent out to collect the water samples, where Bottle contains information regarding the water quality including temperature and salinity. 

## Goal Update
While our dataset contains information for various fish species, we have decided to hone into Sardine to keep our research concise and focused. CALCOFI was founded due to investigate the decline of sardine. Thus, we wanted to update our goal and in the end, create a story with our data exploring the sardine population. To aid us in this, we decided to use Plotly Dash, a tool used where we can create a website with all our important findings and interpretations. We thought of a structure where our page would endlessly scroll down so the user can decide the pace of their reading, alongside making some of our plots interactive for the user.
