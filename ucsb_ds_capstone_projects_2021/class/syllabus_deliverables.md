Each team will complete three progress updates by these dates:
* End of day on January 31, 2021
* End of day on February 21, 2021
* End of day on March 14, 2021

* Consider the document as periodic milestones toward your final report and presentation.
* After initial updates, you can continue to modify and improve your updates.
```
