# Course Syllabus

The project portion of the capstone sequence is cross-listed:

* PSTAT 197B (Winter)/197C (Spring)
* CMPSC 190DE (Winter)/190DF (Spring)

## Lectures and Meeting Times

**Lecture times**: we will discuss topics of interest for the whole class during lecture times (MW 5-6:15 pm PST). Students are expected to attend. We don't expect to meet every session, and Google calendar will reflect any cancellations.

**Team meetings**: each project team will collectively decide on a weekly standing meeting time. A team representative will update the Google calendar with the meeting information including the Zoom link.

**Discussion times**: these times are held as placeholders for any additional help needed (software tools, etc.)

## Grading
